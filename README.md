# CODSOST_SEPT_TASK3

## Here is my 3rd task as UI/UX intern at CodSoft.

- A good restaurant menu UI/UX should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and clearly categorized. Thoughtful use of colors, fonts, and images enhances readability, while clear sections help customers quickly find and select dishes, encouraging them to order more.
- I have used Figma app to complete this project.
